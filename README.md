# 3D-fractals-with-Python-and-Blender
Integrate Python code with Blender to convert SVG vectors into moving 3 dimensional fractals

This code is designed to run inside Blender and take control of the interface

It's a work in progress as you can see, but essentially it will import an svg file (an example is provided) and perform a bunch of transforms on it to get a cool 3D shape that animates

Theres some lines at the end which are silenced but that also allow you to export a video

The intention was to throw in some loops and end up with an NFT generator that could produce thousands of unique videos or images, but unfortunately work has picked up since and I've not had time to complete this
